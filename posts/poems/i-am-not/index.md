<center><b><font color="blue">
I am not a good listener,<br>
but want to listen to you for hours.<br><br>
I am not humorous,<br>
but want to make you laugh.<br><br>
I am not good at time management,<br>
but want to spend time with you.<br><br>
I am not intelligent,<br>
but want to solve complex problems, with you.<br><br>
I am not good at expressing feelings,<br>
but still want to share them with you.<br><br>
I don't know why,<br>
but I want to be with you.<br><br>
</font></b></center></p>
